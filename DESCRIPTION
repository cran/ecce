Description: If translate English words into Chinese, there is a faster 
    way for R user. 'RYoudaoTranslate' package provides interface to 
    'Youdao' <http://youdao.com/> translation open API for R user. 'entcn' 
    package also provides similar features. But it does not support Chinese 
    words translation into English, I have made some improvements on the basis 
    of this software. You can pass in a words or a vector consisting of multiple 
    words, ecce package support both English and Chinese translation. It also 
    support browse translation results in website.
