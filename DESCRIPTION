Description: If translate English words into Chinese, there is a faster 
    way for R user. 'RYoudaoTranslate' package provides interface to 
    'Youdao' <http://youdao.com/> translation open API for R user. 'entcn' 
    package also provides similar features. But it does not support Chinese 
    words translation into English, I have made some improvements on the basis 
    of this software. You can pass in an English or Chinese word, ecce package 
    support both English and Chinese translation. It also support browse 
    translation results in website.
